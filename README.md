# Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This beginner-level machine learning project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features such as fuel type, number of doors, aspiration type, and more. The dataset undergoes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing before training a linear regression model.

## Project Structure
- **EDA**: Visualization of price distribution across categorical features.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, label encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Training a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using MAE and RMSE.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`, which contains specifications and prices of different cars.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook and run each cell sequentially

## Outcomes
- Learned how to perform EDA on a structured dataset.
- Applied data preprocessing techniques for modeling.
- Built and evaluated a Linear Regression model.

## Future Improvements
- Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Add deployment (e.g., Flask app).
